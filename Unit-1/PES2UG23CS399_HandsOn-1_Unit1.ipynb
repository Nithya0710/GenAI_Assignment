    "The introduction of the Transformer architecture in the 2017 paper \"Attention is all you need\" was a watershed moment in AI. It provided a more effective and scalable way to handle sequential data like text, replacing older, less efficient methods like recurrence (RNNs) and convolutions.\n",
    "The fundamental innovation of the Transformer is the attention mechanism. This component allows the model to weigh the importance of different words (tokens) in the input sequence when making a prediction. In essence, for each word it processes, the model can \"pay attention\" to all other words in the input, helping it understand context, resolve ambiguity, and handle long-range dependencies. This is crucial for tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.\n",
    "The Transformer architecture consists of an encoder stack (to process the input) and a decoder stack (to generate the output), both of which heavily utilize multi-head attention and feed-forward networks.\n",
